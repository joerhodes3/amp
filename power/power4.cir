*
* Uses op-amps + power BJTs (MJL3281A/MJL1302A)
*
* use both 24V interally to ouput other voltages to AMPLIFIER [5v, +/-12v, 460v] also plan on using both [tube_GND, VGND]
*   - this way can assume SIGNAL about 12V below tube_GND.......SIGNAL is +/-9V, so worst case -3v relitive to 12ax7 G1 (down to -21v) -- so better
* also has a 12V trigger in and out, as well as a microcontroller @3.3v

* ?? do I really need this -- can I be cheap an not use (what is consiquince of not using)? -- what about TI opa2156 - is overpriced, but since I'm using elsewhere save the "tape cut" fee from supplier.

* Now node 102 is virtual ground (VRAW/2 = 24V) --> output as "tube_GND"

* boost 24v -->output as 460v@.4a "/B+"

* bottom -- swap pwr,GND [tube_GND, -24] == 24V? -or- can I just use 2 QPOS transitors (NPN on both "top" and "bottom) and NOT swap?
* -24V Regulator (referenced to 0V)

* split into +/-12 -- 5V->3.3v in +12V leg -- output +/-12v (?"switch" on based on RC dlay of "pwr"?), 5v (always on), and VGND -- "VGND" is 12v below "tube_GND"
* heater_swicth (RC delay) is Darlington in 24v bottom --> buck 6.3v@5.5a
* output 4 seperate heater power, each with an RC delay to ramp up tube gently

* Load (optional)
